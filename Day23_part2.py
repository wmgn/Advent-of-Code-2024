### Brainstorming Solutions
'''
# option 2
# graph
# find cycle works because a fully connected graph of size 3 is a cycle, even if it wouldn't be for size 4 or higher
# detect complete/connected subgraphs(s) in undirected graph (each complete/connected subgraph of size 3) -- what algorithm? Googled: Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm
# adjacency list
# adjacency matrix

# option 3
# sets ? use sets that have the greatest intersections with eachother?
'''

# option 1
# python dict (hashmap), where each key,value pair is an computer and an array of all the other computers its connected to
# could then brute force check every possible permutation/combination group of 3 unique computers, searching to see if those connections exist
# shortcomings: this method stores 2x data necessary. stores key,value pairs 'ab'=>['cd'] and 'cd'=>['ab'], redundant, since connections are not directional.

# Part 2. Find the largest set of computers that are all connected to each other.

# instead of trying to come up with every possible combination,
# use the connections that are already there, to try to create/assemble a connected set
# every single key has 13 connections
